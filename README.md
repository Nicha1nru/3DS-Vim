# 3DS-Vim
Vim is a pretty amazing text editor for linux/windows, but i'm trying to port my own version of it to the 3DS.
It is completely open source. Just keep in mind that its in early development and has not been fully completed yet. I'm uploading this to hopefully get some critism!

# How it works
Press B to cycle between letters, press A to type the letter. Ignore the letter B at the start, it is a bug im trying to fix.
Press select to reset, press start to exit.

# How to launch it in your 3DS
You need a jailbroken 3DS with homebrew to launch it. Put the SD card in your computer, put the .3dsx file and the lol.elf file into the 3ds folder in your SD card. Then, put it back in your 3DS and launch the program with homebrew.
